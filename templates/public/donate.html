    <h2>Donate to BlackArch</h2>

    <p>BlackArch survives because of the tireless efforts of many people in
    the community and the core development circle.  None of us are paid for
    our work, and we don't have the personal funds to sustain server costs
    ourselves.</p>

    <p>There are many ways to help support BlackArch.  If technical development,
    documentation, or support aren't your strong points, you could certainly
    help us by dropping a few bucks our way.</p>

    <p>Many thanks!</p>
